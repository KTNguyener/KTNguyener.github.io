  - skylar says: ~Of course my parents had us move to the islands in the middle of the year.~
  - skylar says: ~Then again, I've never lived in one place for more than a few years...~

  - mom says: Of course not! Not without breakfast!
  - skylar says: Eggs and bacon! What a treat!
  - mom says: It is technically your first day back at school. You need all the strength you can get.
  - dad says: Hey Sky, can you hit the TV? I need to see what the news is.
  - skylar says: Sure thing dad.
  - news says: In other news, tensions continue to rise between our two nations, and insults are traded over social media.
  - news says: While most of the populace has refused to take the Dictator seriously, making memes of him instead...
  - news says: The President assures us that the Dictator is a very real threat.

  - dad says: He really just wants to make international relationships harder.
  - mom says: Don't let it get to you dear.
  - dad says: I know honey, but it is aggravating to see the words of one man destroy years of my team's work.
  - mom says: There's a reason why you're the best, dear. Even during these times, you still hold your composure.
  - dad says: Only because I know that you and Sky are waiting home for me every day.
  - mom says: We'll always be there for you. Now you go on out and save the world.
  - dad says: Yes Ma'am. Sky! You ready to go?

  - skylar says: Dad! Like I said, don't worry about me. It'll be just like any other move.
  - dad says: Alright, alright, alright. You know where to go?
  - skylar says: Yeah. Thank god we visited school over winter break, or I would be lost.
  - dad says: Okay then. I'll see you soon. Have a good first day!
  - skylar says: I wave to him as he drives off before looking towards the entrance.

  - skylar says: Yes I am. My name is Skylar.
  - teacher says: Nice to meet you. I am Ms. Hayakawa. As you can tell, I teach art here. Are you experienced with it?
  - skylar says: Sort of. Most of what I've drawn is with pencil, and I've never really gone above and beyond with it.
  - teacher says: That's perfectly fine. I grade this class based on what you've done before. As long as you keep improving...
  - teacher says: You should get a good grade. There's no pressure.
  - skylar says: So have students purposely made bad things just to fake improvement?
  - skylar says: Ms. Hayakawa smiles.
  - teacher says: Nope. Some of them are just bad.

  - choice:
    - You're right. It does suck:
      - skylar says: While I try to brush it off so my parents don't get worried, it doesn't stop that feeling, you know.
      - skylar says: The feeling that everybody around me has known the people around them forever while I am always an outsider.
      - show veronica: worried
      - veronica says: I'm sorry to hear that. Sounds like a rough life.
      - skylar says: It was. I broke down a couple of times on the plane when I realized that I could never see my friends again.
      - skylar says: But life goes on, you know? Now I'm here, ready to start the cycle all over again.

    - You get used to it:
      - skylar says: It is rough, but after doing it so many times, it sort of becomes routine.
      - skylar says: You get used to making friends fast and having to enjoy the limited time you have.
      - skylar says: After a while, the culture shock lessens as well.
      - show veronica: normal
      - veronica says: When you put it like that, it sounds like you're one resilient person.
      - veronica says: I would probably break down a little through all that.
      - skylar says: Oh I did break down. Especially after making many close friends.
      - skylar says: But I still try to keep contact
      - skylar says: ~Even if I'm really bad at doing that~
    - I have gained a lot more:
      - skylar says: People make a big deal out of moving, but it really isn't too bad.
      - show veronica: surprised
      - veronica says: Really? How so?
      - skylar says: Once you get past the initial shock of moving, you realize what you gain.
      - skylar says: I've gained broader perspectives, friends across the world, and international experiences.
      - skylar says: It has shaped my world view immensely.
      - veronica says: Wow. Sounds exciting.
      - skylar says: Then again, there's only so many ancient ruins you can see before they start looking the same.

  - teacher says: This jokester right here is Elijah.
  - eli says: Just call me Eli. It's shorter. Less syllables as well.
  - show eli: normal
  - eli says: You ever think it's strange that our letters and syllable lengths are inconsistent?
  - eli says: Or how the plural for tooth is teeth, but the plural for booth is not beeth?
  - choice:
    - English is weird:
      - skylar says: You're right. There are some weird rules that seem inconsistent.
      - eli says: But here's the kicker.
      - show eli: happy
      - eli says: It's always been weird. We just decided to pay attention for once.
    - That's just English:
      - skylar says: English has all sorts of weird rules. That's what makes it English.
      - show eli: happy
      - eli says: Yup. That's probably why so many people got fed up with Englishmen way back when.
  - teacher says: Okay class. Settle down. We will be starting Hamlet today.
  - teacher says: I recommend downloading the No-Fear version, so you could actually understand some of the old English.
  - teacher says: Especially the slang.
  - eli says: Mr. Avellana!
  - teacher says: Yes?
  - eli says: Isn't modern slang hard enough to understand?
  - teacher says: How so?
  - show eli: normal
  - eli says: Well, carjack means to hijack a car, but a car jack is used to lift a car, but to lift a car can mean to steal a car.
  - teacher says: And...
  - eli says: So you can carjack a car with a car jack, lifting it, but without lifting it.

  - skylar says: ~The whole class was silent for a solid five seconds.~
  - skylar says: ~Very slowly, Mr. Avellana put his hands to his head...~
  - skylar says: ~And blew his mind.~

  - skylar says: ~As everyone got their books out, Eli whispered to me.~
  - show eli: happy
  - eli says: Have you read Hamlet yet?
  - skylar says: Yes, I have. My last school had us read it during Junior year.
  - skylar says: Have you?
  - eli says: Yeah. It's my favorite Shakespeare play!
  - show eli: worried
  - eli says: Then again, it's the only Shakespeare play I've read. Should probably work on that.
  - eli says: So you know all of the tragic deaths that happen?
  - skylar says: Yup. It was pretty painful. Especially Ophelia's.
  - eli says: I think her death was the most tragic. Fell in a river while insane with sadness.
  - choice:
    - Make a one-liner pun:
      - skylar says: Yeah. It was pretty sad.
      - skylar says: I guess Ophelia...
      - skylar says: Drowned in her sorrows.

      - eli says: YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
      - skylar says: ~He then goes to sing the rest of the CSI theme, guitars and everything, albeit quietly.~
      - skylar says: ~Though, it still draws looks from surrounding classmates, who roll their eyes at his antics.~
      - skylar says: ~I guess this is normal for them.~
    - Agree with the tragicness:
      - skylar says: Everything that happened to her was awful.
      - skylar says: First, her family tells her her lover doesn't love her.
      - skylar says: Then, she is pushed to go back to him when he starts going insane.
      - skylar says: After that, her former lover kills her father.
      - skylar says: Finally, she goes insane and drowns.
      - skylar says: To top it off, they were debating giving her a proper funeral.
      - eli says: That's just awful, right?
    - Counter with how it showed her strength:
      - skylar says: It is sad, but I think it showed her strength.
      - show eli: surprised
      - eli says: Really? How so?
      - skylar says: Well, you know how Hamlet's indecisiveness gets everyone killed, right?
      - eli says: Mmhm
      - skylar says: And you know how Ophelia has had most her decisions made for her througout her life?
      - eli says: Yup. Pretty bad life.
      - skylar says: In that instant, she made a decision for herself. To leave the corrupt and cruel world of Denmark.
      - skylar says: She essentially said Screw yall. Ya'll are a bunch of crazy corrupt jerks. Bye!

  - teacher says: Well, don't hog all of the good ideas. Save it for the rest of us.
  - skylar says: ~After a few more moments, we start reading Hamlet.~
  - skylar says: ~I may have read it before, but the story still intrigues me.~
  - skylar says: ~I can see it intrigues Mr. Avellana and Eli too. Both of them discover new things as they read it for the nth time.~
  - skylar says: ~The reading goes slowly, but we have lots of discussions along the way.~
