  - skylar says: This is it, I guess.
  - skylar says: Last semester of senior year
  - skylar says: Of course my parents had us move to the islands in the middle of the year.
  - skylar says: Then again, I've never lived in one place for more than a few years...
  - skylar says: So I should've expected something like this to happen. Especially with dad's job.
  - skylar says: Well, no use moping around. I can smell breakfast already
  - show living_day:
  - skylar says: Morning mom! Morning Dad!
  - dad says: Hey Sky! Ready for school?
  - mom says: Of course not! Not without breakfast!
  - skylar says: Eggs and bacon. My favorite!
  - mom says: It is technically your first day back at school. You need all the strength you can get.
  - dad says: Hey Sky, can you hit the TV? I need to see what the news is.
  - skylar says: Sure thing dad.
  - news says: In other news, tensions continue to rise between our two nations and insults are traded over social media.
  - news says: While most of the populace has refused to take the Dictator seriously, making memes of him instead...
  - news says: The President assures us that the Dictator is a very real threat.
  - skylar says: Dad instantly looks more on edge. Him and mom try to speak softly, but I still hear them.
  - dad says: He really just wants to make international relationships harder.
  - mom says: Don't let it get to you dear.
  - dad says: I know honey, but it is aggravating to see the words of one man destroy years of my team's work.
  - mom says: There's a reason why you're the best, dear. Even during these times, you still hold your composure.
  - dad says: Only because I know that you and Sky are waiting home for me every day.
  - mom says: We'll always be there for you. Now you go on out and save the world.
  - dad says: Yes Ma'am. Sky! You ready to go?
  - skylar says: Yeah. In fact, I'm outside the door!
  - dad says: Wait, hold up!
  - mom says: Have a good day you two!

  - dad says: Hey Skylar. Are you gonna be okay?
  - skylar says: Don't worry about me dad. I've done this eight times already.
  - dad says: I know it's hard moving and making new friends, and it's hard getting used to new places every time, and it-
  - skylar says: Dad! Like I said, don't worry about me. It'll be just like any other move.
  - dad says: Alright, alright, alright. You know where to go?
  - skylar says: Yeah. Thank god we visited school over winter break, or I would be lost.
  - dad says: Okay then. I'll see you soon. Have a good first day!
  - skylar says: I wave to him as he drives off before looking towards the entrance.
  - skylar says: A number of students mill about as they return to reality after their fantastical winter break.
  - skylar says: Better head straight to art. No need to converse with strangers.

  - skylar says: This should be the right rooom.
  - skylar says: I double check the sign. Yup, right room. And I'm early as well.
  - skylar says: There's the teacher. Better speak to her before class.
  - skylar says: Good morning.
  - teacher says: Oh! Good morning! You must be the new student.
  - skylar says: Yes I am. My name is Skylar.
  - teacher says: Nice to meet you. I am Ms. Hayakawa. As you can tell, I teach art here. Are you experienced with it?
  - skylar says: Sort of. Most of what I've drawn is with pencil, and I've never really gone above and beyond with it.
  - teacher says: That's perfectly fine. I grade this class based on what you've done before. As long as you keep improving...
  - teacher says: You should get a good grade. There's no pressure.
  - skylar says: So have students purposely made bad things just to fake improvement?
  - skylar says: Ms. Hayakawa smiles.
  - teacher says: Nope. Some of them are just bad.
  - skylar says: I chuckle a little at this.
  - teacher says: This may be the beginning of the symester, but you may be behind in certain aspects. Veronica?
